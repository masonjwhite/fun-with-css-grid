# Fun with CSS Grid


## Summary/Motivation

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

After completing several CSS Grid tutorials, it was time to put my new skills to the test. I poked around, found some layouts I liked, and attempted to build them using CSS Grid.

## Structure

Each directory is a different "project" that contains a simple HTML and CSS file.

- YouTube home page layout
- Human Resources dashboard layout
- Nature lightbox layout
- Course syllabus layout

## Starting the project

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate into the sub-project you wish to explore and open it with your favorite dev server


## Todo

No further plans for development at this time
